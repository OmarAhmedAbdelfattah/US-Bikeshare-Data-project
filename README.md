# US-Bikeshare-Data-project
Udacity project - I have explored the data and it's about bike-share systems for three cities in the US, Chicago, New York City, and Washington. , I created a python file that imports the data, and answers questions about it by computing descriptive statistics and build an interactive environment where a user chooses the data and filters for a dataset to analyze.
